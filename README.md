# Yafl – Yet Another Functional Language

A toy implementation of a tiny functional programming language.

## Summary

Yafl is essentially an implementation of [System F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_F) with a few extensions.
The following illustrates a simple program:

```yafl
((x: Int) => x + 1) 2
```

## Syntax

The syntax of Yafl is described by the production rules below.
The following is assumed:

- Integer literals are contiguous sequences of digits (e.g., `123`); and
- Identifers are strings of alphanumeric characters and the underscore, starting with a non-numeric character (e.g., `foo` or `_23`).
